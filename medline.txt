AB  - This study investigated the neurophysiological and affective responses
      elicited by nature-inspired indoor design elements, including curvilinear
      forms (CL), nature views (N), and wooden interiors (W), in a virtual
      environment, and their effects on cognitive performance. Thirty-six
      participants experienced one control and three experimental conditions in
      a within-subject design. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to record
      neural activity, relaxation and valence ratings assessed affective
      states, and standardized tasks measured cognitive performance. The W
      condition elicited EEG patterns indicative of relaxed attentional
      engagement, including increased alpha-to-theta (ATR) and alpha-to-beta
      (ABR) ratios, and a decreased theta-to-beta (TBR) ratio. These neural
      patterns were associated with higher self-reported relaxation and
      positive affect, and with enhanced cognitive performance relative to the
      control condition. In contrast, the CL and N conditions did not improve
      cognitive performance, and the N condition showed elevated physiological
      arousal, likely due to heightened visual stimulation. Regression analysis
      identified ATR and relaxation as significant predictors of cognitive
      performance, emphasizing the role of emotional stability and neural
      balance in supporting task engagement. Overall, the findings highlight
      the potential of nature-inspired design to foster a synergy between
      psychological relaxation and cognitive attention, though further research
      is needed across diverse spatial typologies to isolate specific design
      parameters.

TI  - Restorative effects and perception of nature-themed artworks in indoor
      environments: an empirical study based on VR+EEG.
PG  - 1571176

AB  - Background: While numerous studies have examined the restorative effects
      of natural elements in indoor environments, limited attention has been
      given to the role of natural analogues. This study investigates the
      restorative effects of nature-themed artwork, a common natural analogue
      in biophilic design. Materials and methods: Virtual reality (VR) was
      employed to simulate five work environments: rooms featuring nature-
      themed artwork, a blank foreground, an architectural window view, a
      natural window view, and a green plant wall, respectively. Measuring
      content included electroencephalography (EEG), blood pressure, heart
      rate, and restorative evaluations to compare the effects of these
      environments on physiological and psychological responses across
      conditions. Results: Nature-themed artwork significantly reduced systolic
      blood pressure (p <0.05), increased alpha wave activity [frontal,
      central, and occipital regions (p <0.05), and elicited higher restorative
      evaluation scores compared to the blank foreground and architectural
      window view]. Positive correlations were found between alpha power
      spectral density (PSD) values and restorative evaluation scores (p
      <0.05). Additionally, no significant differences were found between the
      data induced by nature-themed artworks, the natural window view, and the
      green plant wall. Discussion: The results demonstrate that nature-themed
      artwork exerts restorative effects comparable to direct natural elements
      (natural window views and green plant walls), surpassing both blank walls
      and architectural views. This underscores its potential as an effective
      natural analogue. This study provides reference information for designers
      involved in interior natural decoration, considering physiological,
      neural, and psychological aspects.

TI  - Brain and Subjective Responses to Indoor Environments Related to
      Concentration and Creativity.
LID - 7838 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s24237838 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalograms (EEGs) can be used to study the influence of
      environmental elements on human emotions, cognition, and behavior. EEGs
      can reveal unconscious responses and fill in the gaps left by subjective
      responses provided in survey questionnaires or interviews. EEG research
      on the impact of classroom design elements on concentration and
      creativity is scarce; the design elements studied have not been diverse
      enough. In addition, no researchers have examined the brain and
      subjective responses to multiple indoor environmental elements regarding
      concentration and creativity. Thus, the purpose of this study was to
      explore how the human brain responds to different indoor environmental
      elements as shown by objective EEG signals related to concentration and
      creativity, and their similarities and differences to subjective self-
      reported responses. The experimental stimuli included 16 images combining
      four indoor environmental elements-classroom space shape, furniture
      arrangement, ceiling height, and color-along with images of white walls,
      a full-window wall with a view of nature, and a windowless scenario,
      totaling 19 images. The brainwaves of 20 people collected from eight
      channels were analyzed to determine the concentration index (CI) for
      concentration and relative theta (RT) for creativity. As a subjective
      response, participants were asked to choose the stimuli in which they
      felt they could best concentrate and be most creative in a self-report
      format. The results showed the following tendencies: (a) More brainwaves
      in the parietal and occipital lobes than in the prefrontal or frontal
      lobes; (b) a higher CI with rectilinear shapes, traditional frontal
      furniture arrangements, and red walls; (c) a higher RT with curvilinear
      shapes, collaborative furniture arrangements, white walls, and a full
      view of nature; and (d) participants selected white walls and a front-
      facing furniture layout as supportive of concentration and a full view of
      nature, curvilinear shape, and collaborative furniture layout for
      creative thinking. The results showed that similarities in brain and
      subjective responses were related to furniture layout and shape, whereas
      differences existed in color. This study contributes to the understanding
      of the characteristics of indoor environments that appear to enhance the
      manifestation of concentration and creativity.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of natural exposure in an indoor
      environment on restorative quality and cognitive ability. Thirty
      participants were shown nature at three different indoor sites: baseline,
      indoor (some vegetation), and semi-indoor (a large amount of vegetation
      and view to sky) for five minutes. After viewing, they completed an
      assessment of restoration and a cognitive task, and their
      electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Compared to the baseline, the
      sites with nature resulted in restorative (higher perceived restoration
      scores) and cognitive (higher working memory performance and lower delta-
      to-theta ratio (DTR), delta-to-alpha ratio (DAR), theta-to-beta ratio
      (TBR), and alpha-to-beta ratio (ABR) responses) benefits. These findings
      further our understanding of the effects of exposure to nature on
      restorative and cognitive benefits in an indoor environment, and help to
      build guidance for future research on the effects of nature indoors and
      designing restorative- and cognitive-enhancing indoor spaces.

TI  - Effects of indoor VOCs from paint on human brain activities during
      working memory tasks: An electroencephalogram study.
PG  - e13062

AB  - As more and more people stay inside the building for a long time, the
      indoor environment has a great effect on their health, mood, and work
      efficiency. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals reflect electrical
      activity originating from neuronal firing when a task or activity is
      performed. Since there was no study on the effect of indoor air on
      nerves, this study utilized EEG to preliminarily explore the brain
      functions of subjects during working memory tasks with different
      difficulties. The subjects were divided into two groups according to the
      volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as odor irritants in the air. We
      expected to find the difference in subjects' EEG signals between VOCs and
      low-VOCs. The EEG signals from 60 electrodes were analyzed by event-
      related potential (ERP), event-related spectral power (ERSP), and
      correlation network methods to describe the brain activity. We compared
      the results of subjects in VOCs and low-VOCs and found significant
      differences between ERP and ERSP in the alpha band during a simple
      working memory task. Subjects were more sensitive to the VOCs in simple
      tasks than in complex tasks. Our work provided evidence of odor effects
      on brain functions and could be used to guide the design of indoor odor
      in home, offices, and classrooms.

TI  - A Physiological-Signal-Based Thermal Sensation Model for Indoor
      Environment Thermal Comfort Evaluation.
LID - 7292 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19127292 [doi]
AB  - Traditional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control
      systems rely mostly on static models, such as Fanger's predicted mean
      vote (PMV) to predict human thermal comfort in indoor environments. Such
      models consider environmental parameters, such as room temperature,
      humidity, etc., and indirect human factors, such as metabolic rate,
      clothing, etc., which do not necessarily reflect the actual human thermal
      comfort. Therefore, as electronic sensor devices have become widely used,
      we propose to develop a thermal sensation (TS) model that takes in
      humans' physiological signals for consideration in addition to the
      environment parameters. We conduct climate chamber experiments to collect
      physiological signals and personal TS under different environments. The
      collected physiological signals are ECG, EEG, EMG, GSR, and body
      temperatures. As a preliminary study, we conducted experiments on young
      subjects under static behaviors by controlling the room temperature, fan
      speed, and humidity. The results show that our physiological-signal-based
      TS model performs much better than the PMV model, with average RMSEs 0.75
      vs. 1.07 (lower is better) and R(2) 0.77 vs. 0.43 (higher is better),
      respectively, meaning that our model prediction has higher accuracy and
      better explainability. The experiments also ranked the importance of
      physiological signals (as EMG, body temperature, ECG, and EEG, in
      descending order) so they can be selectively adopted according to the
      feasibility of signal collection in different application scenarios. This
      study demonstrates the usefulness of physiological signals in TS
      prediction and motivates further thorough research on wider scenarios,
      such as ages, health condition, static/motion/sports behaviors, etc.

TI  - A Study of the Effects of Different Indoor Lighting Environments on
      Computer Work Fatigue.
LID - 6866 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19116866 [doi]
AB  - The indoor lighting environment is a key factor affecting human health
      and safety. In particular, people have been forced to study or work more
      for long periods of time at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
      study, we investigate the influence of physical indoor environmental
      factors, correlated color temperature (CCT), and illumination on computer
      work fatigue. We conducted a within-subject experiment consisting of a 10
      min-long task test under two different illumination settings (300 lx and
      500 lx) and two CCTs (3000 K and 4000 K). Physiological signals, such as
      electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiograph (ECG), and eye movement,
      were monitored during the test to objectively measure fatigue. The
      subjective fatigue of eight participants was evaluated based on a
      questionnaire conducted after completing the test. The error rate of the
      task test was taken as the key factor representing the working
      performance. Through the analysis of the subjective and objective
      results, computer work fatigue was found to be significantly impacted by
      changes in the lighting environment, where human fatigue was negatively
      correlated with illumination and CCT. Improving the illumination and CCT
      of the work environment, within the scope of this study, helped to
      decrease the fatigue degree-that is, the fatigue degree was the lowest
      under the 4000 K + 500 lx environment, while it was relatively high at
      3000 K + 300 lx. Under indoor environment conditions, the CCT factor was
      found to have the greatest effect on computer work fatigue, followed by
      illumination. The presented results are expected to be a valuable
      reference for improving the satisfaction associated with the lighting
      environment and to serve as guidance for researchers and reviewers
      conducting similar research.

AB  - Our visual environment impacts multiple aspects of cognition including
      perception, attention and memory, yet most studies traditionally remove
      or control the external environment. As a result, we have a limited
      understanding of neurocognitive processes beyond the controlled lab
      environment. Here, we aim to study neural processes in real-world
      environments, while also maintaining a degree of control over perception.
      To achieve this, we combined mobile EEG (mEEG) and augmented reality
      (AR), which allows us to place virtual objects into the real world. We
      validated this AR and mEEG approach using a well-characterised cognitive
      response-the face inversion effect. Participants viewed upright and
      inverted faces in three EEG tasks (1) a lab-based computer task, (2)
      walking through an indoor environment while seeing face photographs, and
      (3) walking through an indoor environment while seeing virtual faces. We
      find greater low frequency EEG activity for inverted compared to upright
      faces in all experimental tasks, demonstrating that cognitively relevant
      signals can be extracted from mEEG and AR paradigms. This was established
      in both an epoch-based analysis aligned to face events, and a GLM-based
      approach that incorporates continuous EEG signals and face perception
      states. Together, this research helps pave the way to exploring
      neurocognitive processes in real-world environments while maintaining
      experimental control using AR.

TI  - Investigating the relation between electroencephalogram, thermal comfort,
      and cognitive performance in neutral to hot indoor environment.

AB  - The relation between electroencephalogram signals, thermal comfort, and
      cognitive performance in neutral to hot indoor environment was
      investigated. The experiments were carried out at four temperatures: 26
      masculineC, 30 masculineC, 33 masculineC, and 37 masculineC, and two
      relative humidity levels: 50% and 70%. Thirty-two subjects were exposed
      for 175 min. The electroencephalogram signals were measured for 30 min 25
      min after the onset of exposure while the recruited subjects performed
      neurobehavioral tests and rated their thermal comfort. The relative power
      of electroencephalogram signals has a significant correlation with
      thermal comfort and performance of neurobehavioral tests. The ratings of
      acceptability of thermal environment and thermal comfort, the speed,
      accuracy, and PI of completing the tests are negatively correlated with
      the relative power of delta-band, but positively correlated with theta-
      band, alpha-band, and beta-band. The ratings of thermal sensation have a
      better correlation with the above four bands, but the correlation trend
      is opposite. A linear relation was found between electroencephalogram
      signals and the speed. The results showed that the relative power of P7
      channel located in the occipital lobe is the most suitable as a single
      electroencephalogram channel to reflect joint thermal comfort and
      cognitive performance at high temperatures, especially its alpha-band.

TI  - Pilot study of the effects of ventilation and ventilation noise on sleep
      quality in the young and elderly.
PG  - 2226-2238
LID - 10.1111/ina.12861 [doi]
AB  - Three conditions were established to investigate the effects of
      ventilation and related ventilation noise on sleep quality: No mechanical
      ventilation/low noise (A); Mechanical ventilation /low noise (B);
      Mechanical ventilation/high noise (C). The interventions were achieved by
      idling a mechanical ventilation system or operating it in two different
      modes. Nine young people and nine older people were all exposed to each
      of the three conditions for a whole night's sleep, but data from only 15
      subjects were analyzed as three young subjects apparently slept with open
      windows in condition A. Sleep quality was measured objectively with
      polysomnography (PSG), which monitored signals of electroencephalogram
      (EEG), bilateral electrooculogram (EOG), and chin electromyogram (EMG)
      continuously during the sleeping period. Saliva samples were collected
      before sleep at night and after waking in the morning, and the
      concentrations of cortisol and lysozyme in them were determined. Without
      mechanical ventilation, the indoor CO2 level averaged about 1400 ppm
      during the night. Operating the mechanical ventilation decreased the
      indoor CO2 to below 1000 ppm, which improved objectively measured sleep
      quality: wake time after sleep onset (WASO) decreased on average by 15
      min (p < 0.05) and sleep efficiency (SE) increased on average by about 4%
      (p < 0.05). Increased ventilation noise level (50.8dB(A) vs. 34.7dB(A);
      54.9dB(C) vs. 48dB(C)) did not significantly change SE or WASO but did
      change the duration of sleep stages: It decreased the duration of deep
      sleep by 11min (p < 0.05) and REM sleep by 17 min (p < 0.01) and
      increased the duration of light sleep by 17 min (p < 0.05). The
      ventilation noise significantly increased the concentration of lysozyme
      in the elderly (p < 0.05) although no significant effects on cortisol
      could be shown. These results confirm that a low ventilation rate has
      negative effects on sleep quality and that ventilation noise at or above
      50dB(A) may disrupt sleep.

TI  - A Muscular and Cerebral Physiological Indices Assessment for Stress
      Measuring during Virtual Wheelchair Guidance.
LID - 274 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11020274 [doi]
AB  - The work presented in this manuscript has the purpose to assess the
      relationship between human factors and physiological indices. We discuss
      the relationship between stress as human factor and cerebral and muscular
      signals as features. Ten male paraplegic, right-handed subjects were
      volunteers for the experiment (mean age 34 +/-6). They drove a virtual
      wheelchair in an indoor environment. They filled five missions where, in
      each one, an environmental parameter was changed. Meanwhile, they were
      equipped with Electromyography (EMG) sensors and Electroencephalography
      (EEG). Frequency and temporal features were filtered and extracted.
      Principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher's tests, repeated measure
      Anova and post hoc Tukey test (alpha = 0.05) were implemented for
      statistics. Environmental modifications are subject to induce stress,
      which impacts muscular and cerebral activities. While the time pressure
      parameter was the most influent, the transition from static to moving
      obstacles (avatars), tends to have a significant impact on stress levels.
      However, adding more moving obstacles did not show any impact. A
      synchronization factor was noticed between cerebral and muscular features
      in higher stress levels. Further examination is needed to assess EEG
      reliability in these situations.
