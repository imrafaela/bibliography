abstract={This study investigated the neurophysiological and affective responses elicited by nature-inspired indoor design elements, including curvilinear forms (CL), nature views (N), and wooden interiors (W), in a virtual environment, and their effects on cognitive performance. Thirty-six participants experienced one control and three experimental conditions in a within-subject design. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to record neural activity, relaxation and valence ratings assessed affective states, and standardized tasks measured cognitive performance. The W condition elicited EEG patterns indicative of relaxed attentional engagement, including increased alpha-to-theta (ATR) and alpha-to-beta (ABR) ratios, and a decreased theta-to-beta (TBR) ratio. These neural patterns were associated with higher self-reported relaxation and positive affect, and with enhanced cognitive performance relative to the control condition. In contrast, the CL and N conditions did not improve cognitive performance, and the N condition showed elevated physiological arousal, likely due to heightened visual stimulation. Regression analysis identified ATR and relaxation as significant predictors of cognitive performance, emphasizing the role of emotional stability and neural balance in supporting task engagement. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of nature-inspired design to foster a synergy between psychological relaxation and cognitive attention, though further research is needed across diverse spatial typologies to isolate specific design parameters. © The Author(s) 2025.},

abstract={With the growing attention on the indoor health benefits of lighting, exploring its regulatory mechanisms on psychophysiological responses has become a research focus. However, current studies predominantly concentrate on constant illuminances, overlooking the effects of dynamic illuminance changes on psychophysiological responses and lacking consideration of individual differences. This study implemented a three-stage dynamic illuminance exposure scenario consisting of dark–bright–dark phases (bright: 400 lx, 800 lx, 1200 lx) to systematically evaluate the effects of illuminance on light comfort vote (LCV), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Results showed that changes in illuminance significantly modulated the P3, triggering a redistribution of attentional resources in the brain. Under short-term exposure, 800 lx yielded the highest LCV (3.67), the lowest LF/HF and mental stress (1.07 and 0.85, respectively), and the highest frontal asymmetry index (0.54), indicating superior comfort and relaxation. Regression analysis revealed a strong nonlinear association between light sensitivity and the change rate of P3 amplitude, with individual differences being most pronounced in participants with high light sensitivity. A predictive model of LCV based on physiological data achieved a maximum accuracy of 93.33 %, with P3 and LF/HF identified as the most important predictors. Moreover, this study demonstrated the synergistic modulation of the autonomic nervous system and brain activity by dynamic illuminance changes, highlighting individual differences in light comfort. These findings provide valuable insights for differentiated lighting strategies and precise control in indoor environment. © 2025},

abstract={Human cognitive performance is influenced by external factors, including indoor environmental quality (IEQ). Understanding how these factors affect stress, attention, and relaxation is essential in environments such as workplaces and educational institutions, where cognitive function directly impacts performance. This study examines the effects of IEQ on students’ attention and relaxation levels during various lecture periods, focusing on design major students. Three key IEQ parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, and natural lighting) were evaluated for their effects on cognitive states using electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements in a controlled setting. Participants wore non-invasive, portable EEG devices to monitor neurophysiological activity across two sessions, each involving four scenarios: (i) baseline, (ii) increased natural light exposure, (iii) elevated relative humidity, and (iv) increased air temperature. EEG-derived metrics of attention and relaxation were analyzed alongside environmental data, including temperature, humidity, lighting conditions, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), and particulate matter (PM), to identify potential correlations. Results showed that natural light exposure improved relaxation but reduced attention, suggesting a restorative effect on stress that may also introduce distractions. Attention peaked under moderately warm, dry conditions (25–26 °C and 16–19% relative humidity), correlating positively with temperature (Pearson correlation coefficient, (Formula presented.) = 0.32) and negatively with humidity ((Formula presented.) = −0.50). Conversely, relaxation was highest under cooler, more humid conditions (23–24 °C and 24–26% relative humidity). Attention was negatively correlated with CO2 ((Formula presented.) = −0.47) and PM2.5 ((Formula presented.) = −0.46), suggesting that poor air quality impairs alertness. Relaxation showed weaker but positive correlations with PM2.5 ((Formula presented.) = 0.38), PM1.0 ((Formula presented.) = 0.35), and CO2 ((Formula presented.) = 0.32). Ultrafine particles (PM0.3, PM0.5) and TVOC had minimal association with cognitive states. Overall, this study underscores the importance of optimizing indoor environments in educational settings to enhance academic performance and supports the development of evidence-based design standards to foster healthy, effective learning environments. © 2025 by the authors.},

abstract={Despite Electroencephalogram (EEG) potential for establishing responsive indoor environmental controls, its effectiveness in distinguishing diverse thermal states remains uncertain due to inconsistencies in prior research. This study aimed to decipher the neural basis of thermal perception by identifying the most distinctive EEG features for warm, neutral, and cool states, alongside evaluating the impact of main cognitive functions using diverse tasks. It employed a combination of within-subject design—wherein each participant underwent six distinct task types across three thermal states—with a time–frequency Power Spectral Density (PSD) EEG analysis. This integrated approach facilitated robust findings with large number of observations, and desirable statistical powers. We utilized a fine-grained spatio-temporal EEG device compatible with international 10–20 system to capture data. The EEG data analysis examined activity at each of the electrodes specified in this system across all major frequency bands. We discovered that the relative power in the theta band at the O2 scalp position, delta band at the T5 position, and gamma band at the T3 are the top-performing features that consistently distinguish the three thermal states across all participants and tasks. However, the top-performing features varied in pairwise comparisons of the thermal states. The most pronounced impacts of cognitive tasks on thermal perception were observed in the frontal lobe, particularly within the alpha and beta frequency domains. This research enhances our understanding of thermal perception, paving the way for future studies to refine indoor environment optimization using real-time neural feedback. © 2025},

abstract={The light environment constitutes an important facet of indoor environmental quality, intimately intertwined with the well-being and productivity of occupants. Electroencephalogram (EEG) offers distinct advantages in assessing preferred illuminance over subjective evaluations. A correlation model was constructed using EEG dynamic features to clarify the connection between preferred illuminance and brain activity during reading. EEG data were collected from 28 college students exposed to three typical illuminances (200 lx, 500 lx, and 1000 lx). The participants were stratified based on their preferred illuminance, as indicated by the frontal asymmetry index. Notably, individual variances in preferred illuminance were observed. Compared with non-preferred illuminance, brain power significantly decreased by 3.72–32.52 % under preferred illuminance, particularly in the parietal and occipital lobes. The effective delay time of the autocorrelation α oscillations increased by 0.13–9.11 %, while the critical index of neural avalanches decreased by 13.89–42.04 %. These indicate the more comfortable and healthier brain state. Five dynamic features derived from brain oscillations and avalanche activity effectively predicted preferred illuminance, with the K-nearest neighbors algorithm achieving a superior classification accuracy of 77.78 %. This study proposes an innovative approach to assess preferred illuminance and provides theoretical support for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of illuminance on brain activity, facilitating the formulation of individualized lighting comfort models, and promoting resource efficiency and smart indoor environment management. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Biophilic design enhances physical and mental well-being by integrating natural elements and forms to activate humanity's innate biophilic instincts, providing a solution to address escalating stress in modern lifestyles. Compared to visual stimuli, auditory and olfactory stimuli provide more personalized experiences and portability, enabling private customization. This study aimed to investigate the effects of single and combined auditory and olfactory stimuli within biophilic environments on stress relief. 16 participants participated in the study. The experiment utilized traffic noise as a stressor to elicit stress, subsequently randomized to four recovery conditions: 1) auditory (birdsong and flowing water sound), 2) olfactory (sweet orange scent), 3) combined sensory stimuli, and 4) control environment. Physiological indicators, including electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters, were used to assess nervous system function. Additionally, subjective questionnaires including Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE), sound perceptions, and odor pleasantness served as psychological indicators. Both physiological and psychological measures were employed to assess the impact of single or combined sensory stimuli on stress reduction. The findings revealed that noise-induced physiological and psychological stress responses, while a restorative environment designed with biophilic elements significantly facilitated recovery from these stress responses. Combined auditory-olfactory stimuli proved more effective in promoting recovery compared to individual sensory stimulation alone. This study provides important references for the practical application of biophilic design and offers theoretical support for the creation of healthy indoor environments. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The olfactory environment is an important component of the indoor environment, closely related to health, comfort, and performance. This study aims to explore how different plant aromas (peppermint, rose, and lavender) impact stress recovery and electroencephalography (EEG) in university students. EEG signals were recorded from 40 students during the transition from stress-inducing to aroma exposure, analyzing global power (Power total), neural avalanche parameters, and network features of brain. The results indicate that plant aroma exposure improves subjective perception and positive emotions, reducing total mood disturbance by 28.97–30.37 %. Power total significantly decreased by 0.06–0.75 μv², with oscillatory activity more rapidly returning to a comfortable state. Plant aromas significantly enhanced the brain's self-organized criticality. Compared to rose and lavender, peppermint improved the brain's order-disorder balance by 21.79–28.74 %. Rose and lavender had a more positive impact on avalanche activity in females than males. Plant aromas enhanced brain function connectivity, increasing clustering coefficient, global and local efficiency by 4.42–10.36 %, 0.12–8.27 %, and 1.11–2.60 %, respectively, while reducing shortest path length by 1.56–9.99 %, thus improving brain information exchange capabilities. There were close correlations between aroma perception, emotions, and brain oscillatory activity, avalanche activity, and brain networks. This study provides effective indicators for evaluating the effects of aromas on stress recovery and provides fresh insights into the dynamic activities of the brain in indoor olfactory environments. © 2025},

abstract={This study aimed to investigate the effect of visual openness on cognitive function, specifically creativity and engagement. This study, grounded in cognitive load theory, involved the collection of real-time electroencephalogram data from participants undertaking engagement and creativity tasks at different levels of blind openness (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). Our multivariate analysis shows that a moderate degree of blind openness (50% and 75%) is positively associated with creativity. Further, the interaction between blind openness and engagement has a positive influence on creativity. This implies that cognitive function may be improved under an optimal level of visual openness. The findings suggest that an optimal level of visual openness in educational and workplace settings may enhance cognitive function and productivity, potentially informing the design of indoor environments. This study contributes to understanding how physical environmental factors, specifically visual openness, influence cognitive performance.

abstract={Background: While numerous studies have examined the restorative effects of natural elements in indoor environments, limited attention has been given to the role of natural analogues. This study investigates the restorative effects of nature-themed artwork, a common natural analogue in biophilic design. Materials and methods: Virtual reality (VR) was employed to simulate five work environments: rooms featuring nature-themed artwork, a blank foreground, an architectural window view, a natural window view, and a green plant wall, respectively. Measuring content included electroencephalography (EEG), blood pressure, heart rate, and restorative evaluations to compare the effects of these environments on physiological and psychological responses across conditions. Results: Nature-themed artwork significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05), increased alpha wave activity [frontal, central, and occipital regions (p < 0.05), and elicited higher restorative evaluation scores compared to the blank foreground and architectural window view]. Positive correlations were found between α power spectral density (PSD) values and restorative evaluation scores (p < 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences were found between the data induced by nature-themed artworks, the natural window view, and the green plant wall. Discussion: The results demonstrate that nature-themed artwork exerts restorative effects comparable to direct natural elements (natural window views and green plant walls), surpassing both blank walls and architectural views. This underscores its potential as an effective natural analogue. This study provides reference information for designers involved in interior natural decoration, considering physiological, neural, and psychological aspects.

abstract={The acoustic design of indoor environments encompassing spatial configuration, material properties, and sound absorption significantly influences auditory perception and psychological well-being. This study examines the interaction between architectural acoustics, musical stimuli, and neural responses within a controlled therapeutic context, focusing on their effects on stress reduction and relaxation. Electroencephalography (EEG) was utilized to measure brain activity in 24 participants exposed to six musical instruments (piano, violin, guitar, flute, tambourine, and cello) within a simulated environment with systematically varied reverberation and absorption conditions. The results demonstrated that melodic instruments, such as the piano and flute, notably enhanced alpha/α and theta/θ wave activity indicators of relaxation, particularly in spaces with optimized sound absorption. Conversely, percussive instruments, such as the tambourine, and fast rhythmic sequences increased beta/β wave activity, which is associated with heightened arousal and tension. Additionally, varying levels of reverberation and sound reflection further influenced perceptual and neural responses to music. These findings highlight the potential of integrating evidence-based acoustic design and music selection into therapeutic environments, such as hospitals and psychotherapy clinics, to alleviate stress and support patient recovery. © 2025 by the author.},

abstract={Electroencephalograms (EEGs) can be used to study the influence of environmental elements on human emotions, cognition, and behavior. EEGs can reveal unconscious responses and fill in the gaps left by subjective responses provided in survey questionnaires or interviews. EEG research on the impact of classroom design elements on concentration and creativity is scarce; the design elements studied have not been diverse enough. In addition, no researchers have examined the brain and subjective responses to multiple indoor environmental elements regarding concentration and creativity. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore how the human brain responds to different indoor environmental elements as shown by objective EEG signals related to concentration and creativity, and their similarities and differences to subjective self-reported responses. The experimental stimuli included 16 images combining four indoor environmental elements—classroom space shape, furniture arrangement, ceiling height, and color—along with images of white walls, a full-window wall with a view of nature, and a windowless scenario, totaling 19 images. The brainwaves of 20 people collected from eight channels were analyzed to determine the concentration index (CI) for concentration and relative theta (RT) for creativity. As a subjective response, participants were asked to choose the stimuli in which they felt they could best concentrate and be most creative in a self-report format. The results showed the following tendencies: (a) More brainwaves in the parietal and occipital lobes than in the prefrontal or frontal lobes; (b) a higher CI with rectilinear shapes, traditional frontal furniture arrangements, and red walls; (c) a higher RT with curvilinear shapes, collaborative furniture arrangements, white walls, and a full view of nature; and (d) participants selected white walls and a front-facing furniture layout as supportive of concentration and a full view of nature, curvilinear shape, and collaborative furniture layout for creative thinking. The results showed that similarities in brain and subjective responses were related to furniture layout and shape, whereas differences existed in color. This study contributes to the understanding of the characteristics of indoor environments that appear to enhance the manifestation of concentration and creativity. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={The salivary immunoglobulin E (IgE) level that usually acts as an indicator of human immunity could change significantly with the air temperature. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a commonly used technique to assess the thermal responses of the human body to the environment. However, the relations between them under step-change temperatures would still need more evidence. Experiments were conducted in this study to explore the EEG–IgE relation. Three step-changed temperature conditions in the controlled environment by a climate chamber were selected in this study, under which the air temperature was suddenly transitioned from a low temperature of 15°C to higher temperatures of 18°C, 24°C and 30°C, respectively, before returning to the initial low-temperature condition. The subjective questionnaires, the EEG signals and the salivary samples from 14 subjects in these three step-changed temperature conditions were collected. Results showed that the thermal comfort voting was significantly correlated with the EEG spectral power and the IgE concentration. In addition, a significant negative correlation between the frontal lobe spectral power and the salivary IgE changes was observed. The spectral power of the frontal lobe could be used as an objective indicator to evaluate the salivary IgE levels under step-change temperature environments. This study has provided some guidance for future studies of the human immunity responses to the indoor environment in different seasons. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Modern office workers spend lots of time in multi-person offices. For human-centered building design and operation, it is essential to investigate the influence of coupled physical environments on occupants' well-being and task performance. In this study, to assess impacts of thermal and lighting environments on brainworkers, experiments were conducted under 64 conditions of different temperature, correlated color temperature, and illumination in a multi-person office. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected to measure the mental state of brainworkers and neurobehavioral tests were utilized to replicate cognitive tasks. The results indicated that only the interaction between the temperature and illumination regarding the sensation of CCT was significant. Primarily, lower illumination in colder environments made subjects perceive the lighting was warmer. Furthermore, cross-domain effects influenced office workers' sensation via synesthetic effects. And the validity of the hue-heat hypothesis on thermal sensation depended on whether subjects received enough stimulation. Besides, for brainworkers, visual comfort peaked at 5000 K and 750 lux but the optimal temperature varied based on specific requirements, with 24 °C promoting overall comfort and 26 °C enhancing executive cognitive performance. The study preliminarily explored the effects among acceptable levels of T, CCT, and I on EEG features, revealing that temperature could adjust occupants’ mental load. However, the further investigation requests equipment with finer temporal granularity, cost-effective techniques and advanced analytical methods to guide office building design and operation. © 2024},

abstract={Human mobility requires neurocognitive inputs to safely navigate the environment. Previous research has examined neural processes that underly walking using mobile neuroimaging technologies, yet few studies have incorporated true real-world methods without a specific task imposed on participants (e.g., dual-task, motor demands). The present study included 40 young adults (M = 22.60, SD = 2.63, 24 female) and utilized mobile electroencephalography (EEG) to examine and compare theta, alpha, and beta frequency band power (μV2) during sitting and walking in laboratory and real-world environments. EEG data was recorded using the Muse S brain sensing headband, a portable system equipped with four electrodes (two frontal, two temporal) and one reference sensor. Qualitative data detailing the thoughts of each participant were collected after each condition. For the quantitative data, a 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA with within subject factors of environment and mobility was conducted with full participant datasets (n = 17, M = 22.59, SD = 2.97, 10 female). Thematic analysis was performed on the qualitative data (n = 40). Our findings support that mobility and environment may modulate neural activity, as we observed increased brain activation for walking compared to sitting, and for real-world walking compared to laboratory walking. We identified five qualitative themes across the four conditions 1) physical sensations and bodily awareness, 2) responsibilities and planning, 3) environmental awareness, 4) mobility, and 5) spotlight effect. Our study highlights the importance and potential for real-world methods to supplement standard research practices to increase the ecological validity of studies conducted in the fields of neuroscience and kinesiology. © 2024},

abstract={The positive impact of nature on working memory is well established; however, the relationship between indoor nature density, sex, and working memory remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of indoor nature density on working memory and explore sex differences. Forty-one participants (26 females and 15 males) viewed 200 images of indoor environments with varying indoor nature densities. Following image viewing of each density group, participants completed a backward digit span task, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during both image viewing and task performance. The results indicated that as indoor nature density grew, there were increasing trends in backward digit span scores and relative frontal theta during the task and decreasing trends in the frontal theta-to-alpha ratio (TAR), theta-to-beta ratio (TBR), and theta-to-gamma ratio (TGR). According to the post hoc results of relative frontal theta during the task, frontal TAR, and TGR, working memory might be optimized in 25–36% indoor vegetation density. The study also found significant sex differences: females showed more substantial improvements in working memory with increased exposure to indoor nature density than males. This study’s results provide evidence for practical guidelines of designing indoor environments that enhance working memory. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

abstract={Understanding the neural responses to indoor characteristics like temperature and light is crucial for comprehending how the physical environment influences the human brain. Our study introduces an innovative approach using entropy analysis, specifically, approximate entropy (ApEn), applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to investigate neural responses to temperature and light variations in indoor environments. By strategically placing electrodes over specific brain regions linked to temperature and light processing, we show how ApEn can be influenced by indoor factors. We also integrate heart indices from a multi-sensor bracelet to create a machine learning classifier for temperature conditions. Results showed that in anterior frontal and temporoparietal areas, neutral temperature conditions yield higher ApEn values. The anterior frontal area showed a trend of gradually decreasing ApEn values from neutral to warm conditions, with cold being in an intermediate position. There was a significant interaction between light and site factors, only evident in the temporoparietal region. Here, the neutral light condition had higher ApEn values compared to blue and red light conditions. Positive correlations between anterior frontal ApEn and thermal comfort scores suggest a link between entropy and perceived thermal comfort. Our quadratic SVM classifier, incorporating entropy and heart features, demonstrates strong performance (until 90% in terms of AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) in classifying temperature sensations. This study offers insights into neural responses to indoor factors and presents a novel approach for temperature classification using EEG entropy and heart features. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

abstract={The vision of smart buildings that aim to be inclusive needs to take into consideration the diversity of human needs and the various ways in which individuals interact with and experience built environments. This contribution focuses on neurodiversity, specifically investigating how certain design choices and qualities of indoor environments can have distinct impacts on individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In a controlled laboratory setting, we created six conditions with modified lighting and sound designs. Participants (14 with and 13 without ADHD) were asked to perform an on-screen activity within these conditions, which were randomly ordered. The collected data includes biosignals from three devices including 32-channel electroencephalogram (EEG), eye-tracker, health monitoring bracelet, as well as task performance and self-reported comfort levels. We observed significant differences in the EEG data, suggesting the activation of a specific brain activity – a defense system – in situations of discomfort, but only for participants without ADHD. Such observed defense system against uncomfortable environmental conditions seems to be lacking, slow, or weak in participants with ADHD. This difference in neuro-responses underscores the necessity to design adaptive spaces that cater to a broad spectrum of sensory experiences. As we navigate the future of smart environment design, our research accentuates the importance of recognizing and accommodating the diverse sensory responses of individuals, thereby progressing towards truly neuro-inclusive built environments. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract={A Living wall system (LWS) is a biophilic design element that has been introduced into indoor environments in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated that the LWS improves indoor visual comfort and air quality. However, studies on its psychological effects on occupants are still scarce. In this paper, the psychological effects were investigated by recording and analyzing the parameters of occupants’ physiological responses including an electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV). A cross-over experiment was conducted among 43 participants under three different desk work environments based on various materials involving an LWS, a fake LWS, and a bare white wall. The results conclude that LWSs effectively reduce the accumulation speed of negative psychological states caused by desk work to about 1/3, compared with a regular office environment without an LWS. However, occupants tend to be less excited and focused after resting in the LWS environment. Therefore, it is recommended to place LWSs in the rest area rather than close to the desk area in an office building, considering the balance between mental health and work efficiency. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={This study aimed to explore the relationship between nature connectedness and restoration in simulated indoor environments with varying nature densities. Participants (N = 41) were exposed to five sets of images representing varying of indoor nature densities: 0 %, 1%–12 %, 13%–24 %, 25%–36 %, and 37%–100 %. Multiple measurements were employed, including the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS-11), backward digit span task, and electroencephalography (EEG). Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between nature connectedness and perceived restorativeness; however, no significant associations were observed with other restorative indicators. The moderating effect of nature connectedness on perceived restorativeness was examined, revealing that it amplified the impact of simulated indoor nature density on fascination and being away at 18.0 % and 29.3 %, but not 6.2 % and 55.7 %, simulated indoor nature density, respectively. These findings elucidate the intricate relationships between nature connectedness, simulated indoor nature density, and perceived restorativeness. Furthermore, this study contributes to advancing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that explain the restorative benefits of exposure to natural environments, specifically in indoor settings with varying nature densities. Individuals with higher nature connectedness may experience greater subjective restoration when exposed to natural environments, although this may not translate to significant enhancements in objective restoration. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study investigated the correlations between the relative EEG power at different frequency bands under ceiling-fan-integrated air conditioning (CFIAC) systems. Twenty subjects participated in the experiments with the combinations of five air temperature levels (24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 °C) and six ceiling fan gears (Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and closed). The EEG signals and indoor environmental parameters (relative humidity, air velocity, and temperature) were recorded synchronously, and the thermal comfort online survey for each subject was obtained as well. The most comfortable combination was found when the air temperature was 27 °C and the fan speed was 0.3 m/s. When the air temperature was 25 °C, the relative EEG power in the different bands was least distinguishable, but when the temperature rose to 27 °C, it occurred an obvious change in different lobes. The δ, θ, β, and γ-bands significantly correlated with indoor setting temperature for the whole brain, but only the θ-band located at the occipital lobe significantly correlated with ceiling fan speed. The significance for the α-band with setting temperature and the β-band signal with air velocity varies with the subjects. Compared to the common air conditioning (CAC) system, CFIAC had a different effect on the relationship between relative EEG power and exposure environment. The airflow due to the ceiling fan may reverse this relationship between α-band, β-band, and IAT from positive (CFIAC system) to negative (CAC system). This study can contribute to developing wearable sensing data-driven thermal comfort evaluation models. © 2024},

abstract={Electroencephalograms have been proposed as potential physiological indicators to gauge the thermal comfort and cognitive performance of individuals in indoor environments, yet further experimental validation is required. In this study, a simulated experiment was conducted in a climatic room during summer, with temperatures set at 24 °C, 26 °C, 28 °C, 30 °C, and 32 °C. Twenty participants, attired in typical summer clothing (short sleeves and long pants totaling 0.39 clo), undertook cognitive tests assessing short-term memory and concentration while seated, alongside providing thermal comfort ratings. Electroencephalogram signals were continuously recorded from 14 electrode channels across the brain during the second cognitive test unit, spanning the 70th to 90th minute of experimental exposure. The relative power of electroencephalogram signals was computed and analyzed in conjunction with thermal comfort voting, revealing a significant impact of indoor temperature variations on α-band activity in the occipital lobe, with peak α-band relative power observed at 26 °C. Moreover, the whole-brain α-band relative power was significantly higher in states of thermal comfort compared to discomfort, particularly concentrated in the occipital lobe. Linear correlation analysis between cognitive test results and electroencephalogram signals indicated significant associations between the relative power of whole-brain β, δ, and θ bands and scores from the concentration-focused Flanker test. Channels O1 and P8 emerged as potential candidates for single-channel electroencephalogram signals, offering insights into thermal comfort status and cognitive performance related to concentration. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Managing red–green–blue (RGB) lighting conditions within structures may evoke emotions and positively influence behavior. Intelligent RGB lighting systems based on environmental data measurements can substantially enhance the perception of comfort. This study presents a challenge that requires a holistic and integrated approach to implement an automatic RGB artificial lighting control system that can be utilized in various structures and indoor environments. Initially, the challenge spans the identification of environmental variables directly impacting comfort up to the careful selection of suitable sensors. The result is the development of a sophisticated and autonomous system that can adjust RGB lighting in real time, creating environments that are both comfortable and energy-efficient. This automated system fosters the creation of appropriate atmospheres across different contexts. The identification and monitoring of environmental variables are achieved through a neuro-fuzzy control mechanism, where fuzzy rules and membership functions are defined based on late positive potential timings and the influence of artificial lighting on human emotions. The outcomes from this study are an interconnected system capable of performing both online and offline operations to enable the monitoring of environmental variables and the efficient management of artificial lighting based on these metrics. A pilot study, with reference to an EEG wave registry system, yielded significant results. These tests had a statistically relevant result with an average frequency of approximately 9.8 Hz, indicative of a state of comfort among people. Despite a 10% deviation margin, 87% of measurements during the test remained consistent. This research study contributes to human behavior by fostering a relaxing environment and enabling a reduction in energy consumption through the use of efficient lighting. Moreover, the environment intention enables the creation of stimuli in three emotional states: activation, relaxation, and neutral, allowing behavioral adaptation to an intention to occur automatically in fluctuating environmental conditions. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={Real-time prediction of indoor thermal comfort has great potential in the development of a thermal comfort-driven control method for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and the improvement of the indoor environment. This study measured physiological parameters (including electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, and skin temperature (ST)) of 10 male and 10 female volunteers under three temperature conditions (22 °C, 25 °C, and 28 °C). A setup database containing 3600 sets of data was used to develop the thermal comfort prediction model with three machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), back-propagation neural network (BP), and convolutional neural network (CNN). Significant differences were found in both the values and the impact indices of physiological indicators between males and females (p < 0.05). The RF algorithm had a significant advantage with an overall accuracy of 89.3 %. If only one factor is employed for machine learning training, using the RF algorithm and training with the ST dataset is the most appropriate method, with an accuracy of 81.8 %. The addition of all datasets can increase the modeling accuracy to 95.6 %. Taking into account the sample imbalance, the SMOTETomek method was applied. After applying the SMOTETomek method to balance the data, the model accuracy reached at 97.3 %. The comprehensive results showed that thermal comfort prediction for the mixed group of males and females by the RF algorithm using one hybrid model was feasible. The establishment of this model laid the foundation for thermal comfort-driven HVAC control methods and the improvement of indoor environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The office environment's indoor air quality (IAQ) and noise levels are critical factors that affect productivity and overall health. However, a research gap still exists on multi-domain impact of IAQ and noise on human physiological signals. The research aims to establish a comprehensive understanding of the multi-domain impact by analyzing physiological signals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), eye blinks, jaw clenching, and heart rate. 30 human subjects participated in a series of tests in various indoor environments with portable air cleaner configurations. The study incorporated four scenarios with baseline condition and two noise levels. By comparing the different scenarios, the separate and combined impacts of IAQ and noise on office productivity were assessed. Meanwhile, physiological signals were collected and analyzed alongside productivity tests, which included typing and addition tasks, to determine the relationship between IAQ, noise, and office productivity. We discovered a strong relationship between EEG power and productivity, indicating that EEG power was a valuable indicator for evaluating indoor environmental quality, especially the multi-domain effects of IAQ and noise. When using the air cleaner, the relative power in the Theta, Alpha, and Beta bands indicated increased concentration and activity levels in the brain. Additionally, the increasing number of jaw clenching suggested that participants became more anxious and nervous in noisy environments. We also found that there were no gender differences for the analysis of EEG power, providing insights for future research. These findings have implications for smart control and built environment aimed at enhancing office workers' well-being and productivity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

After viewing, they completed an assessment of restoration and a cognitive task, and their electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Compared to the baseline, the sites with nature resulted in restorative (higher perceived restoration scores) and cognitive (higher working memory performance and lower delta-to-theta ratio (DTR), delta-to-alpha ratio (DAR), theta-to-beta ratio (TBR), and alpha-to-beta ratio (ABR) responses) benefits.

abstract={Vegetation in the built environment is known to affect human well-being. Although previous studies have provided quantitative evidence of the benefits of indoor vegetation on human well-being, the effects of vegetation density in indoor environments remain to be explored. To bridge this gap, this study explored the effects of indoor vegetation density on well-being, particularly on perceived restorativeness, stress reduction, and selective visual attention. This study employed the perceived restorativeness scale (PRS-11) and psychophysiological restorativeness (EEG) and found a positive association between increased indoor vegetation density and restorativeness. Despite the restorative effect, there was an inflection point in the indoor environments at 13%–24% vegetation density. For perceived restorativeness and stress reduction, 13%–24% was the most efficient density within indoor environments. Thus, this study contributes a baseline guideline and reference for designers and decision makers to understand efficient vegetation density in indoor environments. © 2023 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: While high concentrations of toluene are known to affect multiple human organ systems, research concerning the influence of immediate, short-term exposure to toluene indoors and at low concentrations is scarce. Here, we studied effects of indoor toluene exposure on neural network alterations during working memory (WM) encoding. Methods: A total of 23 healthy college students were recruited. All participants were situated in a closed environmental chamber with a full fresh air system. Each participant was subjected to four exposure experiments with different toluene concentrations (0, 17.5, 35, and 70 ppb, named Group A, B, C and D, respectively), with at least one week between each experiment. WM Behavioral and 19-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in a pre-set environmental chamber were conducted simultaneously during each toluene exposure experiment. Neural networks relevant to WM encoding were visualized analyzing the obtained data. Results: 1. No significant difference in WM behavioral performance among the four groups was found. However, a significant increase in whole brain neural network functional connectivity was noted, especially in the frontal region. 2. An outflow directional transfer function (DTFoutflow) revealed higher frontal region values among Group D (the 70 ppb group) as compared to Group A, B and C (the0, 17.5 ppb and 35 ppb groups, respectively), although no differences in frontal region DTFinflow values among the four groups were noted. 3. The DTFFZ-F7, DTFFZ-T5, DTFFZ-P4, DTFFZ-P3, DTFFP2-O2, DTFP3-T4, DTFP3-F4, DTFP4-CZ and DTFP4-T4 values of Group D were found to be higher as compared to those of Group A and B. Furthermore, DTFFZ-F7 and DTFP4-T4 values of Group C were higher as compared to those of Group A. The DTFFZ-F7 values of Group D were higher as compared to those of the Group C. Conclusion: Short-term toluene exposure significantly influences neural networks during cognitive processes such as WM encoding, even at low concentration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Twenty male subjects were recruited to record resting EEG signals under thermal conditions consisting of a combination of temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity. Subjective questionnaires were used to collect individuals' perceptions of the environment and as classification criteria for developing logistic regression models. The results indicated that at 22 °C and 25 °C, θ, β1, β2, and γ waves were highly similar, and velocity was also highly similar for all EEG waves at 0.5 and 1 m/s. For β1, β2, and γ, 70% RH can be used as the high humidity cut-off point in the humidity test. In addition, regression models for indoor comfort discrimination utilizing the frequency bands relevant to comfort are regressed, and the total model revealed that 88.6% of the data were correctly categorized.

abstract={Our visual environment impacts multiple aspects of cognition including perception, attention and memory, yet most studies traditionally remove or control the external environment. As a result, we have a limited understanding of neurocognitive processes beyond the controlled lab environment. Here, we aim to study neural processes in real-world environments, while also maintaining a degree of control over perception. To achieve this, we combined mobile EEG (mEEG) and augmented reality (AR), which allows us to place virtual objects into the real world. We validated this AR and mEEG approach using a well-characterised cognitive response—the face inversion effect. Participants viewed upright and inverted faces in three EEG tasks (1) a lab-based computer task, (2) walking through an indoor environment while seeing face photographs, and (3) walking through an indoor environment while seeing virtual faces. We find greater low frequency EEG activity for inverted compared to upright faces in all experimental tasks, demonstrating that cognitively relevant signals can be extracted from mEEG and AR paradigms. This was established in both an epoch-based analysis aligned to face events, and a GLM-based approach that incorporates continuous EEG signals and face perception states. Together, this research helps pave the way to exploring neurocognitive processes in real-world environments while maintaining experimental control using AR. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={There is currently no robust method to evaluate how built environment design affects our emotion. Understanding emotion is significant, as it influences cognitive processes, behavior, and wellbeing, and is linked to the functioning of physiological systems. As mental health problems are becoming more prevalent, and exposure to indoor environments is increasing, it is important we develop rigorous methods to understand whether design elements in our environment affect emotion. This study examines whether the scale of interior built environments modulate neural networks involved in emotion regulation. Using a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and controlling for indoor environmental quality (IEQ), 66 adults (31 female, aged 18–55) were exposed to context-neutral enclosed indoor room scenes to understand whether built environment scale affected self-report, autonomic nervous system, and central nervous system correlates of emotion. Our results revealed enlarged scale increased electroencephalography (EEG) power in the β bandwidth. Frontal midline low-γ and high-γ power were also found to increase with enlarged scale, but contrary to our hypothesis, scale did not modulate frontal midline power or lateralization in the θ or α bandwidths. We did not detect an effect of scale on autonomic indicators or self-reported emotion. However, we did find increased range in skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate variability (HRV) to the built environment conditions. This study provides a rigorous empirical framework for assessing the environmental impact of a design characteristic on human emotion and suggests that measures of high-frequency oscillations may provide a useful marker of the response to built environment. © 2022 Bower et al.},

abstract={Poor learning environments can easily lead to ineffective learning. Hence, previous studies attempted to measure learning environments upon the psychological perceptions of the subjects; however, such method lacked any objective scientific validation. In order to test the influences of indoor classroom setting on learning, this study identified four environmental factors, including lighting, sound, temperature, and smell, as independent variables to conduct the experiment. A portable brainwave instrument and State Anxiety Inventory were respectively used to capture brainwave signals using electroencephalography on 68 subjects in different scenarios. The results show that changes in lighting, sound, and temperature have significant effects on the subjects' concentration level, while changes in lighting and sound are also more likely to affect the subjects' anxiety level. Among the four environmental factors, temperature has the greatest impact on concentration, while the sound is most likely to cause anxiety on the subjects. However, there is no significant relationship between learners’ anxiety and concentration during the learning process. The findings of this study can provide references to the planning and evaluation of future learning spaces. It is recommended that other environmental factors can be tested in the future to establish a more complete learning environment assessment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={As more and more people stay inside the building for a long time, the indoor environment has a great effect on their health, mood, and work efficiency. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals reflect electrical activity originating from neuronal firing when a task or activity is performed. Since there was no study on the effect of indoor air on nerves, this study utilized EEG to preliminarily explore the brain functions of subjects during working memory tasks with different difficulties. The subjects were divided into two groups according to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as odor irritants in the air. We expected to find the difference in subjects’ EEG signals between VOCs and low-VOCs. The EEG signals from 60 electrodes were analyzed by event-related potential (ERP), event-related spectral power (ERSP), and correlation network methods to describe the brain activity. We compared the results of subjects in VOCs and low-VOCs and found significant differences between ERP and ERSP in the alpha band during a simple working memory task. Subjects were more sensitive to the VOCs in simple tasks than in complex tasks. Our work provided evidence of odor effects on brain functions and could be used to guide the design of indoor odor in home, offices, and classrooms. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract={Traditional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control systems rely mostly on static models, such as Fanger’s predicted mean vote (PMV) to predict human thermal comfort in indoor environments. Such models consider environmental parameters, such as room temperature, humidity, etc., and indirect human factors, such as metabolic rate, clothing, etc., which do not neces-sarily reflect the actual human thermal comfort. Therefore, as electronic sensor devices have become widely used, we propose to develop a thermal sensation (TS) model that takes in humans’ physiological signals for consideration in addition to the environment parameters. We conduct climate chamber experiments to collect physiological signals and personal TS under different environments. The collected physiological signals are ECG, EEG, EMG, GSR, and body temperatures. As a preliminary study, we conducted experiments on young subjects under static behaviors by controlling the room temperature, fan speed, and humidity. The results show that our physiological-signal-based TS model performs much better than the PMV model, with average RMSEs 0.75 vs. 1.07 (lower is better) and R2 0.77 vs. 0.43 (higher is better), respectively, meaning that our model prediction has higher accuracy and better explainability. The experiments also ranked the importance of physiological signals (as EMG, body temperature, ECG, and EEG, in descending order) so they can be selectively adopted according to the feasibility of signal collection in different application scenarios. This study demonstrates the usefulness of physiological signals in TS prediction and motivates further thorough research on wider scenarios, such as ages, health condition, static/motion/sports behaviors, etc. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The indoor lighting environment is a key factor affecting human health and safety. In particular, people have been forced to study or work more for long periods of time at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we investigate the influence of physical indoor environmental factors, correlated color temperature (CCT), and illumination on computer work fatigue. We conducted a within-subject experiment consisting of a 10 min-long task test under two different illumination settings (300 lx and 500 lx) and two CCTs (3000 K and 4000 K). Physiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiograph (ECG), and eye movement, were monitored during the test to objectively measure fatigue. The subjective fatigue of eight participants was evaluated based on a questionnaire conducted after completing the test. The error rate of the task test was taken as the key factor representing the working performance. Through the analysis of the subjective and objective results, computer work fatigue was found to be significantly impacted by changes in the lighting environment, where human fatigue was negatively correlated with illumination and CCT. Improving the illumination and CCT of the work environment, within the scope of this study, helped to decrease the fatigue degree—that is, the fatigue degree was the lowest under the 4000 K + 500 lx environment, while it was relatively high at 3000 K + 300 lx. Under indoor environment conditions, the CCT factor was found to have the greatest effect on computer work fatigue, followed by illumination. The presented results are expected to be a valuable reference for improving the satisfaction associated with the lighting environment and to serve as guidance for researchers and reviewers conducting similar research. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Social change due to COVID-19 has had negative impacts on the mental health of people who live indoors. One of the possible solutions to these problems is to introduce biophilic design. Among the elements of this design, green walls are often favored due to their spatial efficiency. This study investigated the effectiveness of green walls in relieving stress indoors. First, the stress level of the occupants of an indoor space that has green walls was measured. Then their psychological and physiological responses to the green walls were analyzed. To this end, using virtual reality, an experimental condition was set up in which a green wall was installed, and the stress level of the subjects was analyzed based on their state-trait anxiety (STAI), heart rate variability, electrodermal activity (EDA), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Twenty-seven subjects were recruited and the changes in their psychological and physiological responses when their environment changed from a non-green wall condition to a small to large green wall condition were measured. The results showed statistically significant differences in STAI, EDA, the relative alpha power in the parietal and occipital lobes, mental stress, and mental fatigue. Ultimately, the small green wall had a more significant relaxing effect. On the other hand, in the indoor space with a large green wall, the stress level of the residents increased. Thus, when installing a green wall in an indoor space, a small green wall is proposed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The relationship between chemical concentrations in indoor air and the human sense of comfort and relaxation have been reported. We investigated the effect of the sum of volatile organic compounds (ΣVOCs; sum of 79 VOCs) on the level of relaxation in two laboratory houses with almost identical interior and exterior appearances. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was monitored to evaluate the degree of personal relaxation objectively. The experiments were conducted in laboratory houses (LH) A and B with lower and higher levels of ΣVOCs, respectively. A total of 168 healthy volunteers participated, who each performed the task for 20 min, followed by a 10-min break, and EEG was measured during the break. Simultaneously as subjective evaluations, the participants were asked to fill a questionnaire regarding the intensity of odor and preference for the air quality in each LH. The subjective evaluation showed a significant association between ΣVOCs and participants’ relaxation (OR: 2.86, 95%CI: 1.24–6.61), and the objective evaluation indicated that the participants were more relaxed in the LH with lower levels of ΣVOCs than that with higher levels (OR: 3.03, 95%CI: 1.23–7.50). Therefore, the reduction of ΣVOCs and odors in indoor air would have an effect, which is the promotion of relaxation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The work presented in this manuscript has the purpose to assess the relationship between human factors and physiological indices. We discuss the relationship between stress as human factor and cerebral and muscular signals as features. Ten male paraplegic, right-handed subjects were volunteers for the experiment (mean age 34 ± 6). They drove a virtual wheelchair in an indoor environment. They filled five missions where, in each one, an environmental parameter was changed. Meanwhile, they were equipped with Electromyography (EMG) sensors and Electroencephalography (EEG). Frequency and temporal features were filtered and extracted. Principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher’s tests, repeated measure Anova and post hoc Tukey test (α = 0.05) were implemented for statistics. Environmental modifications are subject to induce stress, which impacts muscular and cerebral activities. While the time pressure parameter was the most influent, the transition from static to moving obstacles (avatars), tends to have a significant impact on stress levels. However, adding more moving obstacles did not show any impact. A synchronization factor was noticed between cerebral and muscular features in higher stress levels. Further examination is needed to assess EEG reliability in these situations. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Human comfort is linked to health and work performance, and highly depends on the indoor environment. In this study, we studied total comfort in a combined environment by subjective evaluation and electroencephalogram (EEG). A discrete wavelet transform was used to analyze the EEG signals. The results show that thermal, acoustic, visual, and total comforts are significantly correlated and the indoor environments can significantly influence brain cortical activity. In a comfortable environment, the total EEG energy in the parietal lobe (P3, P4) was smaller than in an uncomfortable environment. When subjects felt comfortable, theta frequency-band in the frontal pole (Fp1, Fp2) was significantly increased. These metrics can be used as a biological marker that reflects total comfort in different environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study analyzed the psychophysiological effect of the indoor thermal condition on the college students' learning performance. Towards this end, an experiment was conducted on 20 subjects in a climate chamber. Five thermal conditions (PMV -2, −1, 0, 1, and 2) were created using the climate chamber. The indoor environment quality was monitored. At the same time, to analyze learning performance, the subjects were made to perform four cognitive tests to evaluate attention, perceptual, working memory, and executive ability. Furthermore, the subjects' psychophysiological responses, such as their mental workload, mental stress, alertness, and mental fatigue, were measured using an electroencephalogram. Meanwhile, in this study, the statistical significance of the various factors was investigated using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA. It was found through the analysis that there is a significant negative relationship between alertness and working memory ability in the warm condition, whereas there are significant negative relationships between executive ability on one hand and mental workload, alertness, and mental fatigue on the other in the cool condition. Highest learning performance was at a 25.7 °C indoor temperature. When the indoor temperature decreased to 17 °C, the students' learning performance decreased by about 9.9%, and when the indoor temperature increased to 33 °C, the it decreased by about 7.0%. Therefore, this study confirmed that the indoor thermal condition does not directly influence the students’ learning performance, but it activates the psychophysiological responses of the students, thus increasing their task load. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},
