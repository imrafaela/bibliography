Title = {Study on the psychophysiological responses under dynamic illuminance and
   its influence on light comfort},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {With the growing attention on the indoor health benefits of lighting,
   exploring its regulatory mechanisms on psychophysiological responses has
   become a research focus. However, current studies predominantly
   concentrate on constant illuminances, overlooking the effects of dynamic
   illuminance changes on psychophysiological responses and lacking
   consideration of individual differences. This study implemented a
   three-stage dynamic illuminance exposure scenario consisting of
   dark-bright-dark phases (bright: 400 lx, 800 lx, 1200 lx) to
   systematically evaluate the effects of illuminance on light comfort vote
   (LCV), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.
   Results showed that changes in illuminance significantly modulated the
   P3, triggering a redistribution of attentional resources in the brain.
   Under short-term exposure, 800 lx yielded the highest LCV (3.67), the
   lowest LF/HF and mental stress (1.07 and 0.85, respectively), and the
   highest frontal asymmetry index (0.54), indicating superior comfort and
   relaxation. Regression analysis revealed a strong nonlinear association
   between light sensitivity and the change rate of P3 amplitude, with
   individual differences being most pronounced in participants with high
   light sensitivity. A predictive model of LCV based on physiological data
   achieved a maximum accuracy of 93.33 \%, with P3 and LF/HF identified as
   the most important predictors. Moreover, this study demonstrated the
   synergistic modulation of the autonomic nervous system and brain
   activity by dynamic illuminance changes, highlighting individual
   differences in light comfort. These findings provide valuable insights
   for differentiated lighting strategies and precise control in indoor
   environment.},

Title = {Restorative effects and perception of nature-themed artworks in indoor
   environments: an empirical study based on VR plus EEG},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {Background While numerous studies have examined the restorative effects
   of natural elements in indoor environments, limited attention has been
   given to the role of natural analogues. This study investigates the
   restorative effects of nature-themed artwork, a common natural analogue
   in biophilic design.Materials and methods Virtual reality (VR) was
   employed to simulate five work environments: rooms featuring
   nature-themed artwork, a blank foreground, an architectural window view,
   a natural window view, and a green plant wall, respectively. Measuring
   content included electroencephalography (EEG), blood pressure, heart
   rate, and restorative evaluations to compare the effects of these
   environments on physiological and psychological responses across
   conditions.Results Nature-themed artwork significantly reduced systolic
   blood pressure (p < 0.05), increased alpha wave activity {[}frontal,
   central, and occipital regions (p < 0.05), and elicited higher
   restorative evaluation scores compared to the blank foreground and
   architectural window view]. Positive correlations were found between
   alpha power spectral density (PSD) values and restorative evaluation
   scores (p < 0.05). Additionally, no significant differences were found
   between the data induced by nature-themed artworks, the natural window
   view, and the green plant wall.Discussion The results demonstrate that
   nature-themed artwork exerts restorative effects comparable to direct
   natural elements (natural window views and green plant walls),
   surpassing both blank walls and architectural views. This underscores
   its potential as an effective natural analogue. This study provides
   reference information for designers involved in interior natural
   decoration, considering physiological, neural, and psychological
   aspects.},

Title = {The effect of the preferred illuminance on dynamic features of the brain
   activity during reading},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {103},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The light environment constitutes an important facet of indoor
   environmental quality, intimately intertwined with the well-being and
   productivity of occupants. Electroencephalogram (EEG) offers distinct
   advantages in assessing preferred illuminance over subjective
   evaluations. A correlation model was constructed using EEG dynamic
   features to clarify the connection between preferred illuminance and
   brain activity during reading. EEG data were collected from 28 college
   students exposed to three typical illuminances (200 lx, 500 lx, and 1000
   lx). The participants were stratified based on their preferred
   illuminance, as indicated by the frontal asymmetry index. Notably,
   individual variances in preferred illuminance were observed. Compared
   with nonpreferred illuminance, brain power significantly decreased by
   3.72-32.52 \% under preferred illuminance, particularly in the parietal
   and occipital lobes. The effective delay time of the autocorrelation
   alpha oscillations increased by 0.13-9.11 \%, while the critical index
   of neural avalanches decreased by 13.89-42.04 \%. These indicate the
   more comfortable and healthier brain state. Five dynamic features
   derived from brain oscillations and avalanche activity effectively
   predicted preferred illuminance, with the K-nearest neighbors algorithm
   achieving a superior classification accuracy of 77.78 \%. This study
   proposes an innovative approach to assess preferred illuminance and
   provides theoretical support for a comprehensive understanding of the
   impact of illuminance on brain activity, facilitating the formulation of
   individualized lighting comfort models, and promoting resource
   efficiency and smart indoor environment management.},

Abstract = {The increasing recognition of acoustic comfort in indoor environment
   highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the impact of coloured
   noise as background sound. Coloured noise refers to different types of
   sound with distinct spectrograms and varying intensities. This study
   investigated the effects of coloured noise (represented by white, pink
   and brown noise) on brainwave activity in the temporal lobes, essential
   for auditory recognition, during rest and reading tasks. Twenty-nine
   participants were assessed in a controlled environment under quiet
   conditions and the three noise types. During rest, brainwave activity
   remained stable across noise conditions, except for a significant
   decrease in beta frequency at the T8 electrode when exposed to white
   noise, suggesting its potential to enhance relaxation. In reading tasks,
   pink noise produced significant changes in beta frequency at the T8
   electrode, indicating a relaxation or reduced in effortful cognitive
   processing. In contrast, brown noise exhibited minimal effects on
   brainwave activity in both scenarios. Gender differences were observed,
   with female participants showing greater sensitivity to pink noise
   during reading tasks. These findings highlight the potential of white
   noise (a consistent hissing sound) for relaxation and pink noise
   (resembling steady rainfall) for enhancing cognitive performance and
   learning in indoor environments.},

   Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis approach},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {252},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Despite Electroencephalogram (EEG) potential for establishing responsive
   indoor environmental controls, its effectiveness in distinguishing
   diverse thermal states remains uncertain due to inconsistencies in prior
   research. This study aimed to decipher the neural basis of thermal
   perception by identifying the most distinctive EEG features for warm,
   neutral, and cool states, alongside evaluating the impact of main
   cognitive functions using diverse tasks. It employed a combination of
   within-subject design-wherein each participant underwent six distinct
   task types across three thermal states-with a time-frequency Power
   Spectral Density (PSD) EEG analysis. This integrated approach
   facilitated robust findings with large number of observations, and
   desirable statistical powers. We utilized a fine-grained spatio-temporal
   EEG device compatible with international 10-20 system to capture data.
   The EEG data analysis examined activity at each of the electrodes
   specified in this system across all major frequency bands. We discovered
   that the relative power in the theta band at the O2 scalp position,
   delta band at the T5 position, and gamma band at the T3 are the
   top-performing features that consistently distinguish the three thermal
   states across all participants and tasks. However, the top-performing
   features varied in pairwise comparisons of the thermal states. The most
   pronounced impacts of cognitive tasks on thermal perception were
   observed in the frontal lobe, particularly within the alpha and beta
   frequency domains. This research enhances our understanding of thermal
   perception, paving the way for future studies to refine indoor
   environment optimization using real-time neural feedback.},

Title = {Biophilic environment with auditory-olfactory stimuli contributes to
   psychophysiological restoration from stress},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {275},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Biophilic design enhances physical and mental well-being by integrating
   natural elements and forms to activate humanity's innate biophilic
   instincts, providing a solution to address escalating stress in modern
   lifestyles. Compared to visual stimuli, auditory and olfactory stimuli
   provide more personalized experiences and portability, enabling private
   customization. This study aimed to investigate the effects of single and
   combined auditory and olfactory stimuli within biophilic environments on
   stress relief. 16 participants participated in the study. The experiment
   utilized traffic noise as a stressor to elicit stress, subsequently
   randomized to four recovery conditions: 1) auditory (birdsong and
   flowing water sound), 2) olfactory (sweet orange scent), 3) combined
   sensory stimuli, and 4) control environment. Physiological indicators,
   including electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and
   electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters, were used to assess nervous
   system function. Additionally, subjective questionnaires including Scale
   of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE), sound perceptions, and odor
   pleasantness served as psychological indicators. Both physiological and
   psychological measures were employed to assess the impact of single or
   combined sensory stimuli on stress reduction. The findings revealed that
   noise-induced physiological and psychological stress responses, while a
   restorative environment designed with biophilic elements significantly
   facilitated recovery from these stress responses. Combined
   auditory-olfactory stimuli proved more effective in promoting recovery
   compared to individual sensory stimulation alone. This study provides
   important references for the practical application of biophilic design
   and offers theoretical support for the creation of healthy indoor
   environments.},

Title = {Effects of plant aromas on stress recovery and brain activity in
   university students},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {273},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The olfactory environment is an important component of the indoor
   environment, closely related to health, comfort, and performance. This
   study aims to explore how different plant aromas (peppermint, rose, and
   lavender) impact stress recovery and electroencephalography (EEG) in
   university students. EEG signals were recorded from 40 students during
   the transition from stress-inducing to aroma exposure, analyzing global
   power (Power total), neural avalanche parameters, and network features
   of brain. The results indicate that plant aroma exposure improves
   subjective perception and positive emotions, reducing total mood
   disturbance by 28.97-30.37 \%. Power total significantly decreased by
   0.06-0.75 mu v2, with oscillatory activity more rapidly returning to a
   comfortable state. Plant aromas significantly enhanced the brain's
   self-organized criticality. Compared to rose and lavender, peppermint
   improved the brain's order-disorder balance by 21.79-28.74 \%. Rose and
   lavender had a more positive impact on avalanche activity in females
   than males. Plant aromas enhanced brain function connectivity,
   increasing clustering coefficient, global and local efficiency by
   4.42-10.36 \%, 0.12-8.27 \%, and 1.11-2.60 \%, respectively, while
   reducing shortest path length by 1.56-9.99 \%, thus improving brain
   information exchange capabilities. There were close correlations between
   aroma perception, emotions, and brain oscillatory activity, avalanche
   activity, and brain networks. This study provides effective indicators
   for evaluating the effects of aromas on stress recovery and provides
   fresh insights into the dynamic activities of the brain in indoor
   olfactory environments.},

Title = {Brain and Subjective Responses to Indoor Environments Related to
   Concentration and Creativity},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Electroencephalograms (EEGs) can be used to study the influence of
   environmental elements on human emotions, cognition, and behavior. EEGs
   can reveal unconscious responses and fill in the gaps left by subjective
   responses provided in survey questionnaires or interviews. EEG research
   on the impact of classroom design elements on concentration and
   creativity is scarce; the design elements studied have not been diverse
   enough. In addition, no researchers have examined the brain and
   subjective responses to multiple indoor environmental elements regarding
   concentration and creativity. Thus, the purpose of this study was to
   explore how the human brain responds to different indoor environmental
   elements as shown by objective EEG signals related to concentration and
   creativity, and their similarities and differences to subjective
   self-reported responses. The experimental stimuli included 16 images
   combining four indoor environmental elements-classroom space shape,
   furniture arrangement, ceiling height, and color-along with images of
   white walls, a full-window wall with a view of nature, and a windowless
   scenario, totaling 19 images. The brainwaves of 20 people collected from
   eight channels were analyzed to determine the concentration index (CI)
   for concentration and relative theta (RT) for creativity. As a
   subjective response, participants were asked to choose the stimuli in
   which they felt they could best concentrate and be most creative in a
   self-report format. The results showed the following tendencies: (a)
   More brainwaves in the parietal and occipital lobes than in the
   prefrontal or frontal lobes; (b) a higher CI with rectilinear shapes,
   traditional frontal furniture arrangements, and red walls; (c) a higher
   RT with curvilinear shapes, collaborative furniture arrangements, white
   walls, and a full view of nature; and (d) participants selected white
   walls and a front-facing furniture layout as supportive of concentration
   and a full view of nature, curvilinear shape, and collaborative
   furniture layout for creative thinking. The results showed that
   similarities in brain and subjective responses were related to furniture
   layout and shape, whereas differences existed in color. This study
   contributes to the understanding of the characteristics of indoor
   environments that appear to enhance the manifestation of concentration
   and creativity.},

Title = {Exploring impacts of thermal and lighting conditions on office workers'
   subjective evaluations, cognitive performance and EEG features in
   multi-person offices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Modern office workers spend lots of time in multi-person offices. For
   human-centered building design and operation, it is essential to
   investigate the influence of coupled physical environments on occupants'
   well-being and task performance. In this study, to assess impacts of
   thermal and lighting environments on brainworkers, experiments were
   conducted under 64 conditions of different temperature, correlated color
   temperature, and illumination in a multi-person office.
   Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected to measure the mental
   state of brainworkers and neurobehavioral tests were utilized to
   replicate cognitive tasks. The results indicated that only the
   interaction between the temperature and illumination regarding the
   sensation of CCT was significant. Primarily, lower illumination in
   colder environments made subjects perceive the lighting was warmer.
   Furthermore, cross-domain effects influenced office workers' sensation
   via synesthetic effects. And the validity of the hue-heat hypothesis on
   thermal sensation depended on whether subjects received enough
   stimulation. Besides, for brainworkers, visual comfort peaked at 5000 K
   and 750 lux but the optimal temperature varied based on specific
   requirements, with 24 degrees C promoting overall comfort and 26 degrees
   C enhancing executive cognitive performance. The study preliminarily
   explored the effects among acceptable levels of T, CCT, and I on EEG
   features, revealing that temperature could adjust occupants' mental
   load. However, the further investigation requests equipment with finer
   temporal granularity, cost-effective techniques and advanced analytical
   methods to guide office building design and operation.},

Title = {Electrophysiological effects of Japanese cedarwood on sleep quality in
   humans},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WOOD SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {70},

Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Sleep plays an important role in human health. Changes in the sleeping
   environment can affect sleep quality. The present study investigated the
   effects of natural wood on sleep quality. The interior material was a
   fully used Cryptomeria japonica wood board (Japanese cedar room), while
   the particleboard and medium-density fiberboard (MDF) were covered by a
   vinyl cloth with a woodgrain (resin room). In order to assess sleep
   quality, the sleep-depth index (SDI) is calculated based on the lengths
   of sleep stage 3 and the rapid eye movement (REM) stage using
   electroencephalography (EEG). Before the sleep experiments, the
   Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) and Morningness-Eveningness
   Questionnaire (MEQ) were administered to confirm the participants' usual
   sleep habits. Thirteen participants were invited to sleep in two
   different environments. The MEQ before sleep experiments confirmed that
   eight participants were of the intermediate type and five participants
   were of the moderate evening type. According to the PSQI, three
   participants were poor sleepers and ten were good sleepers. The sleep
   EEG demonstrated that 12 of 13 participants had higher SDI in the
   Japanese cedarwood room than in the resin room. A Wilcoxon signed-rank
   test revealed that SDI was significantly prolonged in the Japanese
   cedarwood room than in the resin room, regardless of the small sample
   size (n = 13, z = 2.48, p = 0.014, effect size = 0.78). The present
   study demonstrated that the indoor environment with C. japonica induced
   a significantly higher SDI compared to that with wood-grain vinyl cloth.
   This indicates that the interior materials of C. Japonica wood can
   positively influence the sleep environment.},

Abstract = {The salivary immunoglobulin E (IgE) level that usually acts as an
   indicator of human immunity could change significantly with the air
   temperature. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a commonly used technique
   to assess the thermal responses of the human body to the environment.
   However, the relations between them under step-change temperatures would
   still need more evidence. Experiments were conducted in this study to
   explore the EEG-IgE relation. Three step-changed temperature conditions
   in the controlled environment by a climate chamber were selected in this
   study, under which the air temperature was suddenly transitioned from a
   low temperature of 15 degrees C to higher temperatures of 18 degrees C,
   24 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively, before returning to the
   initial low-temperature condition. The subjective questionnaires, the
   EEG signals and the salivary samples from 14 subjects in these three
   step-changed temperature conditions were collected. Results showed that
   the thermal comfort voting was significantly correlated with the EEG
   spectral power and the IgE concentration. In addition, a significant
   negative correlation between the frontal lobe spectral power and the
   salivary IgE changes was observed. The spectral power of the frontal
   lobe could be used as an objective indicator to evaluate the salivary
   IgE levels under step-change temperature environments. This study has
   provided some guidance for future studies of the human immunity
   responses to the indoor environment in different seasons.},

Title = {Psychological Effects of a Living Wall System on Office Occupants: A
   Comparative Study Based on Physiological Responses},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A Living wall system (LWS) is a biophilic design element that has been
   introduced into indoor environments in recent years. Previous studies
   have demonstrated that the LWS improves indoor visual comfort and air
   quality. However, studies on its psychological effects on occupants are
   still scarce. In this paper, the psychological effects were investigated
   by recording and analyzing the parameters of occupants' physiological
   responses including an electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate
   variability (HRV). A cross-over experiment was conducted among 43
   participants under three different desk work environments based on
   various materials involving an LWS, a fake LWS, and a bare white wall.
   The results conclude that LWSs effectively reduce the accumulation speed
   of negative psychological states caused by desk work to about 1/3,
   compared with a regular office environment without an LWS. However,
   occupants tend to be less excited and focused after resting in the LWS
   environment. Therefore, it is recommended to place LWSs in the rest area
   rather than close to the desk area in an office building, considering
   the balance between mental health and work efficiency.},

   ceiling-fan-integrated air conditioning system},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {257},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {This study investigated the correlations between the relative EEG power
   at different frequency bands under ceiling-fan-integrated air
   conditioning (CFIAC) systems. Twenty subjects participated in the
   experiments with the combinations of five air temperature levels (24,
   25, 26, 27, and 28 degrees C) and six ceiling fan gears (Levels 1, 2, 3,
   4, 5, and closed). The EEG signals and indoor environmental parameters
   (relative humidity, air velocity, and temperature) were recorded
   synchronously, and the thermal comfort online survey for each subject
   was obtained as well. The most comfortable combination was found when
   the air temperature was 27 degrees C and the fan speed was 0.3 m/s. When
   the air temperature was 25 degrees C, the relative EEG power in the
   different bands was least distinguishable, but when the temperature rose
   to 27 degrees C, it occurred an obvious change in different lobes. The
   delta, theta, beta, and gamma-bands significantly correlated with indoor
   setting temperature for the whole brain, but only the theta-band located
   at the occipital lobe significantly correlated with ceiling fan speed.
   The significance for the alpha-band with setting temperature and the
   beta-band signal with air velocity varies with the subjects. Compared to
   the common air conditioning (CAC) system, CFIAC had a different effect
   on the relationship between relative EEG power and exposure environment.
   The airflow due to the ceiling fan may reverse this relationship between
   alpha-band, beta-band, and IAT from positive (CFIAC system) to negative
   (CAC system). This study can contribute to developing wearable sensing
   data-driven thermal comfort evaluation models.},

Title = {Experimental study on the physiological parameters of occupants under

   machine learning algorithms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Real-time prediction of indoor thermal comfort has great potential in
   the development of a thermal comfort-driven control method for heating,
   ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and the improvement of
   the indoor environment. This study measured physiological parameters
   (including electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, electroencephalogram (EEG)
   signal, and skin temperature (ST)) of 10 male and 10 female volunteers
   under three temperature conditions (22 degree celsius, 25 degree
   celsius, and 28 degree celsius). A setup database containing 3600 sets
   of data was used to develop the thermal comfort prediction model with
   three machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF), back-propagation
   neural network (BP), and convolutional neural network (CNN). Significant
   differences were found in both the values and the impact indices of
   physiological indicators between males and females (p < 0.05). The RF
   algorithm had a significant advantage with an overall accuracy of 89.3
   \%. If only one factor is employed for machine learning training, using
   the RF algorithm and training with the ST dataset is the most
   appropriate method, with an accuracy of 81.8 \%. The addition of all
   datasets can increase the modeling accuracy to 95.6 \%. Taking into
   account the sample imbalance, the SMOTETomek method was applied. After
   applying the SMOTETomek method to balance the data, the model accuracy
   reached at 97.3 \%. The comprehensive results showed that thermal
   comfort prediction for the mixed group of males and females by the RF
   algorithm using one hybrid model was feasible. The establishment of this
   model laid the foundation for thermal comfort-driven HVAC control
   methods and the improvement of indoor environments.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effects of natural exposure in an indoor
   environment on restorative quality and cognitive ability. Thirty
   participants were shown nature at three different indoor sites:
   baseline, indoor (some vegetation), and semi-indoor (a large amount of
   vegetation and view to sky) for five minutes. After viewing, they
   completed an assessment of restoration and a cognitive task, and their
   electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Compared to the baseline, the
   sites with nature resulted in restorative (higher perceived restoration
   scores) and cognitive (higher working memory performance and lower
   delta-to-theta ratio (DTR), delta-to-alpha ratio (DAR), theta-to-beta
   ratio (TBR), and alpha-to-beta ratio (ABR) responses) benefits. These
   findings further our understanding of the effects of exposure to nature
   on restorative and cognitive benefits in an indoor environment, and help
   to build guidance for future research on the effects of nature indoors
   and designing restorative- and cognitive-enhancing indoor spaces.},

Title = {Study on occupants' window view quality vote and their physiological
   response},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The window view quality related to the window view motif was recently
   introduced in buildings' certification methods such as LEED, BREAM, WELL
   and in technical standard EN 17037 as well. The experimental study of
   psychological and physiological response of observers to window view was
   performed in thermostatic chamber at class I of indoor environment
   quality conditions. The aim of the study was to: i) review models for
   numerical characterization of window view motifs; ii) collect observers'
   votes of window view quality, using 5-point Likert scale, with
   experiment simulating different window view motifs; iii) propose a new
   model for predicting window view quality vote, based on characterization
   of a window view motif, with additional consideration of sunny or cloudy
   conditions; iv) measure the brain waves power during window view
   observation in resting state, using wearable electroencephalography
   device, to find out to what extend ob-servers' votes correlates with
   their physiological response. The results show that window view votes
   increase in case of dominance of natural elements, however the window
   view votes of built environment significantly increase in case of sunny
   conditions as well. No significant difference in window view votes was
   found regarding to the gender or age of observers. It was found that
   ranking, used in reviewed methods, significantly differ in correlation
   to our experimental results, with Spearman's correlation index from-0.35
   (EN 17037) to 0.85 (View-out Quality Index method). The best fit model
   was upgraded with additional parameter, indicating sunny or cloudy
   conditions, defined as Window View Index. The power of alpha waves, the
   frontal alpha asym-metry and the alpha to beta ratio were used as
   physiological response indicators, because they are related to the
   observes' resting state. It was found out that physiological response is
   significantly less pronounced as observers' votes. Among analyzed
   biomarkers frontal alpha asymmetry shows the highest positive response,
   regardless of gender, to window views with dominated natural elements
   and also to sunny conditions. Based on these results we recommend
   frontal alpha asymmetry as most suitable biomarker in research of window
   view impact on well-being of occupants.},

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {228},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {This study investigated the effect of indoor thermal conditions on
   electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and used logistic regression to
   discriminate indoor, thermal comfort. Twenty male subjects were
   recruited to record resting EEG signals under thermal conditions
   consisting of a combination of temperature, relative humidity, and air
   velocity. Subjective questionnaires were used to collect individuals'
   perceptions of the environment and as classification criteria for
   developing logistic regression models. The results indicated that at 22
   degrees C and 25 degrees C, theta, beta 1, beta 2, and gamma waves were
   highly similar, and velocity was also highly similar for all EEG waves
   at 0.5 and 1 m/s. For beta 1, beta 2, and gamma, 70\% RH can be used as
   the high humidity cut-off point in the humidity test. In addition,
   regression models for indoor comfort discrimination utilizing the
   frequency bands relevant to comfort are regressed, and the total model
   revealed that 88.6\% of the data were correctly categorized. This
   research serves as a starting point for further research into the
   coupled environment and neuronal mechanisms.},

Title = {The influence of indoor environmental factors on learning: An experiment
   combining physiological and psychological measurements},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {221},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Poor learning environments can easily lead to ineffective learning.
   Hence, previous studies attempted to measure learning environments upon
   the psychological perceptions of the subjects; however, such method
   lacked any objective scientific validation. In order to test the
   influences of indoor classroom setting on learning, this study
   identified four environmental factors, including lighting, sound,
   temperature, and smell, as independent variables to conduct the
   experiment. A portable brainwave instrument and State Anxiety Inventory
   were respectively used to capture brainwave signals using
   electroencephalography on 68 subjects in different scenarios. The
   results show that changes in lighting, sound, and temperature have
   significant effects on the subjects' concentration level, while changes
   in lighting and sound are also more likely to affect the subjects'
   anxiety level. Among the four environmental factors, temperature has the
   greatest impact on concentration, while the sound is most likely to
   cause anxiety on the subjects. However, there is no significant
   relationship between learners' anxiety and concentration during the
   learning process. The findings of this study can provide references to
   the planning and evaluation of future learning spaces. It is recommended
   that other environmental factors can be tested in the future to
   establish a more complete learning environment assessment.},

Journal = {INDOOR AIR},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {As more and more people stay inside the building for a long time, the
   indoor environment has a great effect on their health, mood, and work
   efficiency. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals reflect electrical
   activity originating from neuronal firing when a task or activity is
   performed. Since there was no study on the effect of indoor air on
   nerves, this study utilized EEG to preliminarily explore the brain
   functions of subjects during working memory tasks with different
   difficulties. The subjects were divided into two groups according to the
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as odor irritants in the air. We
   expected to find the difference in subjects' EEG signals between VOCs
   and low-VOCs. The EEG signals from 60 electrodes were analyzed by
   event-related potential (ERP), event-related spectral power (ERSP), and
   correlation network methods to describe the brain activity. We compared
   the results of subjects in VOCs and low-VOCs and found significant
   differences between ERP and ERSP in the alpha band during a simple
   working memory task. Subjects were more sensitive to the VOCs in simple
   tasks than in complex tasks. Our work provided evidence of odor effects
   on brain functions and could be used to guide the design of indoor odor
   in home, offices, and classrooms.},

Abstract = {The indoor lighting environment is a key factor affecting human health
   and safety. In particular, people have been forced to study or work more
   for long periods of time at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
   study, we investigate the influence of physical indoor environmental
   factors, correlated color temperature (CCT), and illumination on
   computer work fatigue. We conducted a within-subject experiment
   consisting of a 10 min-long task test under two different illumination
   settings (300 lx and 500 lx) and two CCTs (3000 K and 4000 K).
   Physiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG),
   electrocardiograph (ECG), and eye movement, were monitored during the
   test to objectively measure fatigue. The subjective fatigue of eight
   participants was evaluated based on a questionnaire conducted after
   completing the test. The error rate of the task test was taken as the
   key factor representing the working performance. Through the analysis of
   the subjective and objective results, computer work fatigue was found to
   be significantly impacted by changes in the lighting environment, where
   human fatigue was negatively correlated with illumination and CCT.
   Improving the illumination and CCT of the work environment, within the
   scope of this study, helped to decrease the fatigue degree-that is, the
   fatigue degree was the lowest under the 4000 K + 500 lx environment,
   while it was relatively high at 3000 K + 300 lx. Under indoor
   environment conditions, the CCT factor was found to have the greatest
   effect on computer work fatigue, followed by illumination. The presented
   results are expected to be a valuable reference for improving the
   satisfaction associated with the lighting environment and to serve as
   guidance for researchers and reviewers conducting similar research.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Traditional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control
   systems rely mostly on static models, such as Fanger's predicted mean
   vote (PMV) to predict human thermal comfort in indoor environments. Such
   models consider environmental parameters, such as room temperature,
   humidity, etc., and indirect human factors, such as metabolic rate,
   clothing, etc., which do not necessarily reflect the actual human
   thermal comfort. Therefore, as electronic sensor devices have become
   widely used, we propose to develop a thermal sensation (TS) model that
   takes in humans' physiological signals for consideration in addition to
   the environment parameters. We conduct climate chamber experiments to
   collect physiological signals and personal TS under different
   environments. The collected physiological signals are ECG, EEG, EMG,
   GSR, and body temperatures. As a preliminary study, we conducted
   experiments on young subjects under static behaviors by controlling the
   room temperature, fan speed, and humidity. The results show that our
   physiological-signal-based TS model performs much better than the PMV
   model, with average RMSEs 0.75 vs. 1.07 (lower is better) and R-2 0.77
   vs. 0.43 (higher is better), respectively, meaning that our model
   prediction has higher accuracy and better explainability. The
   experiments also ranked the importance of physiological signals (as EMG,
   body temperature, ECG, and EEG, in descending order) so they can be
   selectively adopted according to the feasibility of signal collection in
   different application scenarios. This study demonstrates the usefulness
   of physiological signals in TS prediction and motivates further thorough
   research on wider scenarios, such as ages, health condition,
   static/motion/sports behaviors, etc.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the indoor
   thermal condition on people's stress and thermal comfort under acute
   stress. Therefore, an experiment was carried out on 20 human subjects in
   the climate chamber. Three thermal conditions (PMV = -1, PMV = 0 and PMV
   = 1) were created. Trier social stress test was used as the program to
   stimulate acute stress and was divided into three stages: Pre-stressor,
   Stressor task and Post-stressor under each thermal condition. To analyse
   stress and thermal sensation, a survey was conducted and human subjects
   completed questionnaire provided about their responses. Furthermore, the
   psychophysiological responses of subjects were measured by
   electroencephalogram at different thermal conditions. The results
   indicate that subject's stress is not significantly related to the
   thermal environment conditions in the stage of Pre-stressor. However, a
   neutral and slightly cold environment can reduce the stress of the
   subjects in the Stressor task, while a slightly warm environment would
   increase more acute stress. The thermal environment and psychological
   stress were found to have a combined effect, which could affect the
   thermal sensation, thermal comfort and acceptability of the environment
   when subjects were under acute stress stimulation.},

Title = {Towards real-world neuroscience using mobile EEG and augmented reality},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Our visual environment impacts multiple aspects of cognition including
   perception, attention and memory, yet most studies traditionally remove
   or control the external environment. As a result, we have a limited
   understanding of neurocognitive processes beyond the controlled lab
   environment. Here, we aim to study neural processes in real-world
   environments, while also maintaining a degree of control over
   perception. To achieve this, we combined mobile EEG (mEEG) and augmented
   reality (AR), which allows us to place virtual objects into the real
   world. We validated this AR and mEEG approach using a well-characterised
   cognitive response-the face inversion effect. Participants viewed
   upright and inverted faces in three EEG tasks (1) a lab-based computer
   task, (2) walking through an indoor environment while seeing face
   photographs, and (3) walking through an indoor environment while seeing
   virtual faces. We find greater low frequency EEG activity for inverted
   compared to upright faces in all experimental tasks, demonstrating that
   cognitively relevant signals can be extracted from mEEG and AR
   paradigms. This was established in both an epoch-based analysis aligned
   to face events, and a GLM-based approach that incorporates continuous
   EEG signals and face perception states. Together, this research helps
   pave the way to exploring neurocognitive processes in real-world
   environments while maintaining experimental control using AR.},

Abstract = {The relation between electroencephalogram signals, thermal comfort, and
   cognitive performance in neutral to hot indoor environment was
   investigated. The experiments were carried out at four temperatures:
   26oC, 30oC, 33oC, and 37oC, and two relative humidity levels: 50\% and
   70\%. Thirty-two subjects were exposed for 175 min. The
   electroencephalogram signals were measured for 30 min 25 min after the
   onset of exposure while the recruited subjects performed neurobehavioral
   tests and rated their thermal comfort. The relative power of
   electroencephalogram signals has a significant correlation with thermal
   comfort and performance of neurobehavioral tests. The ratings of
   acceptability of thermal environment and thermal comfort, the speed,
   accuracy, and PI of completing the tests are negatively correlated with
   the relative power of delta-band, but positively correlated with
   theta-band, alpha-band, and beta-band. The ratings of thermal sensation
   have a better correlation with the above four bands, but the correlation
   trend is opposite. A linear relation was found between
   electroencephalogram signals and the speed. The results showed that the
   relative power of P7 channel located in the occipital lobe is the most
   suitable as a single electroencephalogram channel to reflect joint
   thermal comfort and cognitive performance at high temperatures,
   especially its alpha-band.},

Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {204},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Social change due to COVID-19 has had negative impacts on the mental
   health of people who live indoors. One of the possible solutions to
   these problems is to introduce biophilic design. Among the elements of
   this design, green walls are often favored due to their spatial
   efficiency. This study investigated the effectiveness of green walls in
   relieving stress indoors. First, the stress level of the occupants of an
   indoor space that has green walls was measured. Then their psychological
   and physiological responses to the green walls were analyzed. To this
   end, using virtual reality, an experimental condition was set up in
   which a green wall was installed, and the stress level of the subjects
   was analyzed based on their state-trait anxiety (STAI), heart rate
   variability, electrodermal activity (EDA), and electroencephalogram
   (EEG). Twenty-seven subjects were recruited and the changes in their
   psychological and physiological responses when their environment changed
   from a non-green wall condition to a small to large green wall condition
   were measured. The results showed statistically significant differences
   in STAI, EDA, the relative alpha power in the parietal and occipital
   lobes, mental stress, and mental fatigue. Ultimately, the small green
   wall had a more significant relaxing effect. On the other hand, in the
   indoor space with a large green wall, the stress level of the residents
   increased. Thus, when installing a green wall in an indoor space, a
   small green wall is proposed.},

Abstract = {The work presented in this manuscript has the purpose to assess the

   virtual wheelchair in an indoor environment. They filled five missions
   where, in each one, an environmental parameter was changed. Meanwhile,
   they were equipped with Electromyography (EMG) sensors and
   Electroencephalography (EEG). Frequency and temporal features were
   filtered and extracted. Principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher's
   tests, repeated measure Anova and post hoc Tukey test (alpha = 0.05)
   were implemented for statistics. Environmental modifications are subject
   to induce stress, which impacts muscular and cerebral activities. While
   the time pressure parameter was the most influent, the transition from
   static to moving obstacles (avatars), tends to have a significant impact
   on stress levels. However, adding more moving obstacles did not show any
   impact. A synchronization factor was noticed between cerebral and
   muscular features in higher stress levels. Further examination is needed
   to assess EEG reliability in these situations.},
